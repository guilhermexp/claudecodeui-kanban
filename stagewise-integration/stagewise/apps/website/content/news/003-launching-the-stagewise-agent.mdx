Today, we're thrilled to launch the stagewise Agent, the next step in our mission to make frontend development faster and more intuitive.

Building on the success of our open-source toolbar, the stagewise Agent allows you to build and iterate on your app's frontend visually, directly on localhost.

## The Problem with AI in Frontend Development

AI-powered app builders are fantastic for simple prototypes, but they fall short when you move into a production-grade project. The awesome experience of visually building your app with simple prompts gets lost.

You switch to powerful AI code editors, but they aren‚Äôt great for frontend work because:

- They don‚Äôt understand your app's user experience.
- They only see the codebase, not what‚Äôs happening in the browser.
- You're forced into tedious context switching between your browser and your IDE.


## Going beyond integrations with code editors

The existing stagewise toolbar up until now required you to always keep an IDE running and was highly limited in capabilities due to restrictive and unstable APIs.

Fixing this situation is our first step to make stagewise attractive for wider and more regular use.


## The Solution: The stagewise Agent

With stagewise, we bring the power of a full-fledged AI coding agent directly into your web app. Our framework-independent toolbar works with your existing projects, allowing you to prompt changes by simply clicking and commenting on elements in your app. The agent automatically collects browser and app metadata to make precise changes to your local codebase.

No more tedious context switching. Just seamless, intuitive frontend development.


## Our Vision

We believe the best user experiences are built by iterating fast and putting yourself in the shoes of your user. Our product enables teams to do exactly that. We are working towards a future where amazing, production-grade user experiences can be built lightning-fast, even without deep coding skills.
