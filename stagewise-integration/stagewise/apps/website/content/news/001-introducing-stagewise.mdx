Today, we're excited to launch **stagewise**, an open-source toolbar that connects IDE coding agents with your website.
We call this **"Eyesight for your AI coding agent."**

## Open-Source and Extensible

Making stagewise open-source was a no-brainer for us. We believe that the main differentiator between AI-powered solutions is the **UX of the application layer**. With stagewise, we want to showcase a new way to vibe code in existing codebases.

Our codebase is licensed under AGPLv3, making it free to use for both open-source and commercial projects, though you may not commercialize products that contain stagewise itself.

## How to Get Started

To get started with stagewise, you need to do the following:

1.  **Install the stagewise code editor extension**
    - Follow the link on our landing page or search for it in your IDE's extension store.

2.  **Integrate stagewise into your project's codebase**
    - Once installed, the extension will guide you through integrating stagewise into your project.

3.  **Start prompting**
    - After integrating stagewise, you can visit your web app in development mode and start prompting.

## What's Next?

In the upcoming weeks, we'll be working hard to make stagewise even better by delivering more features and improving compatibility with other IDEs.
