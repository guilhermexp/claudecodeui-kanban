We're excited to announce that after the initial success of our open-source launch, Stagewise is part of the Y Combinator S25 batch!

## Why We're Joining

Y Combinator gives us the chance to work on Stagewise with full focus and build an ecosystem around the initial traction we've received.

Our goal is to create a more sophisticated solution that enables both technical and non-technical stakeholders to build great frontends with visual vibe coding.

## Beyond the MVP

Despite the initial success of Stagewise, a few problems have emerged that significantly limit its use. Our goal is to build the next iterations of Stagewise that tackle these issues step-by-step.

Here's a list of issues we've repeatedly heard from our community:

-   Difficult installation
-   Limited IDE support
-   Recurring issues with app integration
-   No proper chat interface, only one-shot commands are possible
-   No feedback from agents

Joining Y Combinator will enable us to tackle these problems as quickly as possible and go beyond that. We're confident that Stagewise is the perfect starting point for building an AI-powered frontend development agent that is flexible and easy to use.

## We're Staying Open Source

It's important for us to reiterate that we will continue to keep Stagewise open-source.

While we may not open-source additional services built around the toolbar, the toolbar itself, as well as all the interfaces for connecting agents and building plugins, will remain open source.
