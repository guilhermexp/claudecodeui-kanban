## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Rust >= 1.70.0
- Git

### Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:

   npm install
   cd vibe-kanban/backend && cargo build && cd ../..
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit using conventional commits:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with..."
   git commit -m "docs: update README"
   ```

3. Run tests:

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Create a Pull Request

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Follow Prettier formatting rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer functional components in React
- Use hooks instead of class components

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Sends a message to Claude
 * @param {string} message - The message to send
 * @param {string} projectPath - The project path
 * @returns {Promise<string>} The response from Claude
 */
export async function sendMessage(message, projectPath) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Rust

- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix warnings
- Add documentation comments
- Write unit tests for new functionality

Example:
```rust
/// Handles task creation requests
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `task` - The task to create
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<Task, Error>` - The created task or error
pub async fn create_task(task: NewTask) -> Result<Task, Error> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Support both light and dark themes

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Test additions or corrections
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add voice transcription to chat interface
fix: resolve websocket disconnection on mobile
docs: update installation guide for Windows users
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run Rust tests
cd vibe-kanban/backend && cargo test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```javascript
describe('ChatInterface', () => {
  it('should send message when Enter is pressed', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should show error when message fails to send', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to new functions
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Add examples for new features
